The Svalbox DB runs on a PostgreSQL/PostGIS instance that is only accessible from within the UNIS network, and then only through whitelisted admin accounts.
As such, access is provided on a need-to-have basis and special care must be given to not distribute access information.

This page deals with the data uploaders available to uploading data to the Svalbox servers, currently being:

1. [](svaldropbox) - for digital model data
2. Nicegui-photospheres - for 360 degree imagery data
