# Welcome to the Svalbox uploading tutorial

This is a basic tutorial that takes you through the process of committing data to the Svalbox project.
Currently, only digital outcrop model (DOM) and photosphere data are directly ingested into our databases.
Other data, however, are most welcome and form an important contribution to collecting as much geoscience information on Svalbard as possible.

These tutorial pages contain two distinctive chapters:

1. An uploader's/user's tutorial on how to commit data sets;
2. An archivist's tutorial on how to accept/ingest data into the databases.
